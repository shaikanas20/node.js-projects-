Employee Management System – Description

FUNCTIONALITY:
            A simple command-line application built with Node.js and the readline module.
            It allows users to manage employees by adding new employees, listing all employees, and removing employees by their ID.

COMPONENTS BREAKDOWN
ELEMENT 1: Readline Interface
            Purpose: Enables interaction with the user through the command line.
            Properties: Uses standard input and output from the terminal.
            Effect: Allows the program to ask questions and receive user input.

ELEMENT 2: Employees Data Store
            Purpose: Holds the list of employees in memory.
            Properties: Employees are stored in an array, where each employee has a name and an ID.
            Effect: Keeps track of employee information while the program is running.

ELEMENT 3: Main Menu
            Purpose: Provides options for the user to interact with the system.
Options:
            Add Employee
            List Employees
            Remove Employee
            Exit

            Effect: Based on the user’s choice, the program runs the corresponding function.

ELEMENT 4: Add Employee
            Purpose: Collects employee details (name and ID) from the user.
            Process: Prompts the user for name and ID → Stores the new employee in the array.
            Effect: A confirmation message is displayed after adding.

ELEMENT 5: List Employees
            Purpose: Displays all employees currently stored.
            Process: If the list is empty, a message is shown. Otherwise, each employee is listed with their name and ID.
            E            ffect: Allows the user to see the current employee database.

ELEMENT 6: Remove Employee
            Purpose: Deletes an employee by ID.
            Process: User enters an ID → The system searches for it → If found, the employee is removed and a success message is shown. If not found, an error message is displayed.
            Effect: Keeps the employee list updated by removing unwanted records.

ELEMENT 7: Exit Option
            Purpose: Ends the program safely.
            Effect: Closes the readline interface and prints a goodbye message.

PROCESS FLOW:
            Program starts and shows the main menu.
            User selects an option.
            The chosen function (Add, List, Remove, Exit) runs.
            After completing an action, the menu is displayed again until the user exits.

TEST CASES:
            Choosing Add Employee and entering details → Employee is added successfully.
            Choosing List Employees after adding → Shows all employees.
            Choosing Remove Employee with a valid ID → Employee is removed and confirmation is shown.
            Choosing Remove Employee with an invalid ID → Error message displayed.
            Choosing List Employees with no data → Message “No employees found” appears.
            Choosing Exit → Program ends with “Goodbye” message.

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
            Employee records are stored only during program execution (in memory).
            User-friendly messages appear for each action.
            The menu keeps reappearing until the user exits.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:
            Using Node.js readline for command-line interaction.
            Implementing menu-driven programs.
            Working with arrays to store, search, and delete data dynamically.
            Practicing input validation and user-friendly error handling.
